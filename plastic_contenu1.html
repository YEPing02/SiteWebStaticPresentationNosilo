					<h1>Why should your Information System focus on get rid of plastic?</h1>
					<h2>The economic reasons:	</h2>
					<p>The price of raw materials has increased of 6% since 2000, and became more and more volatile with 80% of the products that will be thrown in the first 6 months of their life. There are more and more partners in the Circular Economy which are referenced in many web sites as circle-economy.com or economiecirculaire.org. The major partner is Ellen MacArthur, which is the partner of Renault since 2010.	</p>
					<p>From the side of the consumers, the ecological label takes more and more place in their mind. Actually, 30% of them are aware of these labels without necessarily taking them into consideration, whereas 23% of the consumers are aware and take it into account.</p>
					<p>This is related with many ecological scandals like the Garbage Island which made the global opinion aware of the problem of plastic. If we focus on the automobile industry, 94.3% of the sold vehicles are from green class with 48% of them in class B (just after the class A).</p>
					Renault was the world leader in the automobile industry in 2017. To keep its place, Renault has to search for innovations and new politics which are part of the Green Business. If we add this imperative to the trend of being aware of the plastic’s problem, we can easily show that Renault has to make a big investment to get rid of virgin plastic.
					<p>Each company has a Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and because of Renault situation, it should try to make its best to make CSR one of its mains goals. Actually, an ADEME study in 2016 showed that sorting of waste has allowed to save 3 million euros each year. Because of the part of plastic that represents 20% of a car in average, this constitute a non-negligible saving.</p>
					<p>To conclude, Renault can take part of the economic trend to keep his position.</p>
					<h2>The social reasons:</h2>
					<p>Secondly, we have to focus on the social reasons.</p>
					<p>Companies have to respect the social laws, beyond that, each company should try to do their best to improve their social image. In fact, it could make customers more attracted (the marketing and economic part) as well as engineers and many employees who will support the company because of their fidelity.</p>
					<p>Trying to get rid of plastic could have a benefic impact on the unemployment as much as the health and the working conditions of the employees.</p>
					<p>The Circular Economy had created 3.9 million jobs around the world where 800 000 of them are in France and represent 21% of the jobs related with Circular Economy.</p>
					<p>France is a major actor of the green business. Renault should focus on the green business and particularly on the plastic’s problem because it would permit to relocate some part of</p>
					<p>Renault production in France and would improve his image for Europeans and so for the rest of consumers.</p>
					<p>The production of a car represent some risks for the employees.</p>
					<p>We’ll focus on the plastic production because it represents a risk of dermatological disease linked with the plastic residues (as phenol for example) which represent a cost for Renault. Moreover, there was a scandal in France with the Cleon’s Renault’s factory where some overseers asked to the employees to not take health break.</p>
					<p>Be aware of recycling plastic is shown as a benefic politic because of the improving investment of each employee in the company. In fact, each employee feels like a real actor in the company and in the ecology.</p>
					<p>Finally, we can highlight that trying to get rid of plastic has a social interest for the development of Renault.</p>
					<h2>The marketing reasons:</h2>
					<p>From now, we’ll focus our point of view to the expenses of Renault and think of the opportunities to improve its sales.</p>
					<p>Marketing services use the Green Business to improve their sales. We will show why Renault should go ahead to get rid of plastic by demonstrating the impact that such communication as well as such strategy could have on his position in the market.</p>
					<p>The Green Washing is in fashion. Actually, 3% of the 13 964 ads saw in 2013 used the ecological argument, and 93% of them complied with the deontological recommendations. Therefore, the problem with the vehicles ads is that only 2% of them are more overcautious. It means that the rest could contain some exaggerations, which could lead to the loss of consumers’ confidence. Trying to get rid of plastic, it’s distinguishing oneself from the rest of the competitors; Renault is the leader of the Automobile industry since 2017, so he has an impulse role. Moreover, it suffered from its product’s quality compared to the competitors.</p>
					<p>With the development of the Green Business, the trend of the consumers to be more responsible and the plastic part in each vehicle that has grown (+20% of plastic since 1970), it seems logical to make sorting waste a main problem. From the side of the benefits, Renault has proved that taking care of the sorting waste leads to profits. The main illustration is the partnership with Ellen MacArthur (a major partner of the Circular Economy) since 2010 to recycle plastic: it allowed to save 0.5 Billion euros each year thanks to this partnership and this policy.</p>
					<p>To conclude, such a policy is positive to the company because of the opportunities to grab market share and strengthen consumer loyalty.</p>
					<h2>The legal reasons:</h2>
					<p>At last, we will demonstrate that Renault has a big interest trying to do his best on getting rid of virgin plastic. Besides of the opportunities, Renault has to forge ahead because of the fast evolution concerning plastic production and Data protection.</p>
					<p>We will finish by studying the future “Bonus-Malus’ system” as well as the obligation to be aware of the General Rules of the Data Protection (GRDP). The French government wants to force companies to get rid of virgin plastic with the “Bonus-Malus” law which will become effective in 2019. Each company would have a bonus going up to 10% of the plastic price if the company recycle it. However, the company would have penalties if it uses another source of plastic than the recycled plastic.</p>
					<p>Beginning a green business required a strong Information System to collect data and use them to implement an efficient recycling process. These collects are for lucrative purposes so the Information System needs to agree with the GRPD’s law. Renault has to provide a Data Protection Officer and a Responsible of Treatment.</p>
					<p>To conclude, we saw that Renault’s Information System has an interest focusing into getting rid of plastic because in a general way, everyone involved are in line with the law.</p>
