					<h1>Marketing and branding</h1>
<p>Renault markets its products under five marques: Renault, Lada, Dacia, Renault Samsung Motors, and Alpine.</p>

<h2>Renault badge</h2>
<p>Renault's first badge was introduced in 1900 and consisted in the Renault brothers' intertwined initials. When the company started mass production in 1906, it adopted a gear-shaped logo with a car inside it. After World War I the company used a logo depicting an FT tank. In 1923 it introduced a new circle-shaped badge, which was replaced by the "diamond" or lozenge in 1925. The lozenge of Renault means a diamond that expresses the brand's firm desire to project a strong and consistent corporate image.</p>

<p>The Renault diamond logo has been through many iterations. To modernise its image, Renault asked Victor Vasarely to design its new logo in 1972. The transformed logo maintained the diamond shape. The design was later revised to reflect the more rounded lines of the brand's new styling cues.The current badge has been in use since 1992.</p>

<p>The logo for web and print use was updated three times thereafter. In 2004 a more realistic representation inside a yellow square with the word "Renault" in Renault Identité typeface besides it was incorporated. In 2007, Saguez & Partners produced a version with the word "Renault" inside the yellow square.</p>

<p>In April 2015, Renault introduced new designs to differentiate the company from the product brand, as part of the 'Passion for life' campaign. The new brand logo replaced the yellow background with a yellow stripe. A new typeface was also introduced. A corporate logo was unveiled at the 2015 Annual General Meeting, incorporating Renault, Dacia and Renault Samsung Motors.</p>
<p>The yellow associated with the company appeared initially in the diamond badge of 1946, when Renault was nationalised.</p>
<h2>Typeface</h2>
<h3>Renault MN</h3>
<p>Both the Renault logo and its documentation (technical as well as commercial) historically used Renault MN, a custom typeface developed by British firm Wolff Olins. This type family is said to have been designed mainly to save costs at a time where the use of typefaces was costly.</p>

<p>A retail version of the font family was sold by URW++ as Renault.</p>

<h3>Renault Identité</h3>
<p>In 2004, French typeface designer Jean-François Porchez was commissioned to design a replacement. This was shown in October of that year and was called Renault Identité.[257] The OpenType font family was developed from the Renault logotype created by Éric de Berranger.</p>

<h3>Helvetica</h3>
<p>Since 2007, as part of the Saguez & Partners revamp, all graphic advertising makes use of Helvetica Neue Condensed.</p>

<h3>Renault Life</h3>
<p>The Renault Life font family was built by Fontsmith Limited, based on the foundry's FS Hackney font family.</p>

<p>The family consists of six fonts in three weights (Life, Regular, and Bold) and one width, with complimentary italic.</p>

<h2>L'Atelier Renault Paris</h2>
<p>Renault's flagship showroom, L'Atelier Renault (French pronunciation: ​[latəlje ʁəno]), is located on the Champs-Élysées in Paris, with other manufacturers such as Peugeot, Citroën and Toyota. It opened in November 2000, located on the site of Pub Renault, which operated from 1963 to 1999. The first Renault venue at the location was the Magasin Renault in 1910, a pioneering car showroom.</p>

<p>L'Atelier features a Renault Boutique as well as regular exhibitions featuring Renault and Dacia cars. An upmarket restaurant is located on the second floor, looking out onto the Champs-Élysées. The ground floor can hold up to five exhibitions at any one time. As of March 2009, 20 million visitors had visited L'Atelier Renault.</p>

<h2>Renault Classic</h2>
<p>Renault Classic is a department within Renault that seeks to collect, preserve and exhibit notable vehicles from the company's history. Originally named Histoire & Collection, the collection was assembled in 2002 and its workshops formally opened on 24 April 2003.</p>

<h3>Music</h3>
<p>Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Renault's European advertising made extensive use of Robert Palmer's song "Johnny and Mary". Television advertisements initially used Palmer's original version, while a range of special recordings in different styles were produced during the 1990s, most famously the acoustic interpretation by Martin Taylor that he released on his album Spirit of Django.</p>

<h3>Sponsorship</h3>
<p>Renault is a sponsor of the Port Adelaide Football Club in the Australian Football League, signing a three-year deal in 2013.</p>

<p>Renault has sponsored films as an advertising technique since 1899. A Renault Voiturette Type A, driven by Louis Renault, appeared in one of the Lumiéres' early films. Between 1914 and 1940, the company commissioned a series of documentary films to promote its industrial activities.Renault also backed some films set in Africa during the 1920s to promote the reliability of its products on tough conditions.Since 1983, the company sponsors the Cannes Film Festival and it has also sponsored other festivals as the Venice Film Festival, the Marrakech Film Festival and the BFI London Film Festival.</p>

<p>Through its foundations and institutes, Renault funds projects around the world that focus on: education through scholarships, road safety and diversity.</p>
