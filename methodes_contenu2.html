					<h1>Optimization of IS and 3D printers</h1>
<p>Having detailed plastic management in Renault's IS and introduced the importance of AI in the plastic’s life cycle of the operating system, it is essential to finish this chapter by giving concrete solutions to IS optimization.</p>
<p>The effectiveness of the information system is a key issue in the ecological footprint. Better managed computer hardware means there is less need for it in quantity, so less plastic is necessary. Indeed, remember that a computer is composed of 22.99% plastic, which gives it the second position in the ranking in terms of materials used.</p>
<p>Although hardware and IT infrastructure must be applied in the company because obviously they are very useful, there is still the major drawback of having an obsolescence programmed on each hardware. This obsolescence clearly leads to efforts to be made in terms of maintenance, and that is another cost for the company.</p>
<p>Today, it is estimated that most servers and workstations of large companies like Renault are only used between 8 and 15% when they are lit. Regarding the energy cost, it can now represent up to 40% of a company's overall IT budget. Finally, for 1 € spent on the purchase of a computer, you have to spend more than 50 cents on energy. And because of the obsolescence of the material, for the same computer it will be necessary to foresee 71 cents in 4 years.</p>
<p>For all these economic and ecological reasons, several solutions exist. They are simple and feasible to put in place, and thanks to them, not only the energy footprint will be improved, but also the economic cost will be reduced by the decrease of direct purchases (purchase of computer, maintenance) and indirect purchases (energy cost). After a more complete interview with Renault about what we can do, we will have the pleasure of reading and signing the IT charter to be able to access the IS of the company and implement the following solutions.</p>

					<h1>Optimization of IS </h1>
					<h2>Virtualization</h2>
					<p>It is a technique that reduces the number of machines used in an Information System while providing processing power, and cost control. Server virtualization makes it possible to host multiple physical machines on a single server, in other words, with virtualization, it is possible to operate on a single physical machine, several operating system: this is called server consolidation. Virtualization appears as a viable solution given the latest statistics, as the power available in modern machines is far from being fully used. Fewer computers but more power is a winning combo to not only save money but also save energy and use less plastic for production!</p>
					<p>There are multiple advantages about virtualization. First, it allows you to run a program originally planned on a different operating system from the one you usually use. In terms of security, the virtual machine also makes it possible to surf in a completely secure way since the possible infections contracted will be done at the level of the virtual machine and not at the level of the host machine. Finally, developers will be able to create different development environments and specific tests on the same machine, which is a huge gain of time for them and their work.</p>
					<p>There are different solutions of virtualization such as VirtualBox, VMWare, Virtual PC.</p>
					<h2>Cloud computing</h2>
					<p>After doing this work on virtualization, what comes naturally after, is an effort put on the cloud. Imagine a 100% information system in a cloud: no need for a single server, no need for any IT infrastructure. The 100% is a mandatory rule in the Silicon Valley when a start-up is created, because these growing companies must be flexible, fast and innovative. In France we are a little overcautious with the cloud, but some companies are already well anchored in this sector. In France, SaaS is still largely the most used type of cloud service, at 48%; LaaS is 19% and finally PaaS only 5%.</p>
					<p>To be clear, we do not advise Renault to migrate to 100% cloud. Indeed, it would not be at all adapted to their structure and their trades. Economically it would not make much sense since for a company with a strong existing, applications like ERP, accounting on a well-defined perimeter and fixed number of users, make the cost of such a transition very heavy and expensive. However, it is still possible to partially migrate the information system into the cloud before reaching a certain cost and feasibility limit. There are several things to know about moving to the cloud. First of all, it is necessary to treat the problem of the network connection, where in France it is not yet ubiquitous, because the network accesses remain a key point of the diffusion of the cloud. Then, the data security problems arise: given the sensitivity of business information, access had to be completely secure. Finally, the cloud does not correspond to certain trades, for example the 3D design is, with its strong constraints in terms of computing power, display and large volumetric of its files, one of the last system to resist the cloud, although technical efforts are triggered.</p>

						<h1>What about your 3D printers?</h1>
						<p>Speaking of 3D printing, we know that at Renault, these systems are used in research and development. 3D printing is a very good technology, unfortunately, it has the huge disadvantage of being environmentally dangerous. In fact, the organic components released during printing are irritating and potentially toxic. In addition, many thermoformable plastics are used as main components, without ever being recycled.	</p>
							<p>Fortunately, it is possible with some start-ups to order environmentally friendly filaments. The price of 1kg of recycled filaments are in a fairly large price range of 22-45 euros (given the diversity of solutions), while the price of 1kg of standard filaments are in a range of 30-35 euros. Finally, there is also the technique of "do it yourself" since plastic extruders are gradually appearing on the 3D printing market with the key the possibility of creating its own printing filament. Existing projects include ProtoCycler, FilaMaker, 3DEvo, FelFil Evo, Filabot or Plastibot. Using recycled filaments instead of standard filaments seems to be a simple and efficiency solution to achieve your goal, which is using more recycled plastic.</p>
